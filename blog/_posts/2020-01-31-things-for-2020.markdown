There are a few key concepts that worked well for me in 2019 that I'm bringing into 2020.

## Mini habits

Mini habit — a goal so small that's impossible to fail, repeated daily.

Let me explain the idea with an example. Instead of setting one big goal for a long period of time, such as _read 10 books in a year_, I set the smallest goal I can achieve every single day, such as _read 2 pages a day_. It's an extremely simple concept, and that's why it works.

I can't stress enough how mini habits influenced my life since I read [the book](). Actually, I consider my life split into two eras now — before reading the book and after. By the end of the article, you'll understand why. And mind you, I'm not paid a penny to say that. It just worked so fucking well.

So in 2020, mini habits are at the core of everything I want to focus on — be it building a business, stretching my back or keeping in touch with friends. At the end of the day, I don't care if I hit this or that number. It doesn't matter. As long as I stay consistent — I know I make progress. Even though the effects are not visible in day to day compartments, in the long-term it makes wonders.

The smallest step at a time — you simply can't fail with this approach.

## Diet

I've switched to a ketogenic diet nearly two years ago and never looked back since.

What is it about? It's a low-carb diet where the main source of energy — glucose — is replaced by another — ketones. The macro is 5% carbs, 25% protein, 70% fat. Ok, but what does it mean? No bread, pasta, rice, sugar, fruits nor beer. Instead, lots of high-quality meat, oil, eggs and green veggies and a glass of red wine (from time to time).

Although the diet has positive effects on my body, I mainly do it for the benefits it brings to my brain. I mean:
* Mood swings? Gone.
* Sugar spikes? Gone.
* Sleepy afternoons? Gone.
* Irritable bowel syndrome? Gone completely.
* High energy levels? Constant.
* Clarity of thought? Always.

Side effects? Losing body fat. A blessing for many, but a curse for me. But I can't be much leaner anyway, so I guess I have to live with it. Or rather without it.

Be warned though, it's a simple diet but not an easy one. It's very restrictive and it requires some radical lifestyle changes.

Going out to restaurant nearly always ends up in an awkward favour to a waiter about altering some of the ingredients in the ordered dish. I nearly completely dropped drinking alcohol, apart from occasional glasses of red wine or small amounts of pure spirits. Beer and gin & tonic are a no-go.

I know many who tried this diet and only one who sustained for more than a month. You must be really disciplined to be successful at it — as at any other thing in life, really. And I'm not the saint one too — I've had my on-and-offs to keep me sane.

All I know is that it's doing miracles for me and I'm bringing it into 2020 with a lean smile on my face.

## Exercise

After reading the book, I've started a mini habit of just 2 min of any exercise a day. It could be as simple as holding legs in the air while lying on the back. I mean, something that I could do with no excuses - even dead-tired in bed.

After consistently hitting — and often overreaching — that stupid-small goal every single day for 3 months, it was already so built-in my brain that I've stopped tracking it. After a few more months, I've build such a momentum that I got to a point of  doing 45 minutes of gym and 45 minutes of cycling to work and back, 5 times a week. I can't deny, working at Fiit with like-minded people served me well in this matter.

However, in 2020 I'm changing two things. First, I don't cycle anymore because now I work from home. Second, since the keto diet doesn't really allow me to build mass in terms of body fat, I'm left with the muscles growth only. This requires a serious focus on heavy weight-lifting. And so, I'm trying out strict 60-minute 5x5 workouts, 3 times a week. I've already done it for over a month, and hell, I loved it.

I'm not planning to use any gainers to artificially boost my progress though. Just pure organic keto food and 3g of creatine every morning should get me there. But where exactly? Well, there's no finish line with this one.

As I said before, numbers don't matter. All I have to focus on is a habit - the results will follow.

## Technology

Now let's take the opposite look at the mini habits - what is helping me achieve them.

There's no denying that technology is an important piece of my day-to-day life. I've studied computer science and been working in tech industry for over 6 years now, so of course I became a technology geek.

Here's a few tech things I discovered in 2019 that I'm bringing into 2020:

### Brain.fm

It's an app that allows you to stream music composed using scientific methods to stimulate your brain. Combine it with the headphones and you're entering another dimension of focus. The app itself is not the most intuitive nor extremely reliable but works for the most part and the benefits outtake the drawbacks by miles. Apparently you can get a month free if you sign up with a referral link (brain.fm/invite/lapw1zn5J7). I don't think I get anything from that but I don't really care - I'm already on a yearly subscription.

### Habits (iOS app)

I recently discovered this app and loved it at first sight. It's ultra simple and has everything you need to track your habits. Moreover, the core functionality is free and totally enough for day-to-day use. For Android alternative check {% include link.html href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.jaystory.minihabits&hl=en" content="miniHABITs" %} app.

### Apple stock apps

After years of using other apps, mainly Evernote and Wunderlist, last year I finally moved all my stack to Apple ecosystem.

My key productivity apps now are Notes and Reminders. They're essential, they don't have any fancy functionality. But they have everything I need.

I love the fact that everything syncs so seamlessly across all my devices. It's something that wasn't always the case with the third party apps.

Additionally I respect the company for two things:
* One, they build high quality products and services that work together just as you expect them to.
* Two, they care about users privacy (or at least they claim so, anyway no major recent data breaches give no reason to think otherwise).

To make things clear, I'm not an Apple fanboy. I'm a pragmatic consumer that appreciates well-made products and services.

## Meditation / Gratitude

{% include link.html href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1093360165" content="Simple Habit" %} app.

It's scary, how easy it is to forget about your mission. To lose mindset. To start drifting comfortably with no direction.

I came back to Poland with a mission. Nothing else mattered. Not long time after, everything shattered.

Last but not least on the list is gratitude.

I heard here and there that it's a serious thing and very important for achieving happiness in life but for most of the 2019 I simply ignored it. Eventually, it came upon me.

The catharsis moment happened in October when I came back to my house in Poland after spending 2.5 years in lovely London.

I made a difficult choice to quit my well-paid job and move out for a few months in order to fully focus on my business.

All of the sudden, I started appreciating every single thing around me. Not only the things I lacked in London, but the  ones that I haven't appreciated here before. I mean literally everything, from comfy bed and birds chirping every morning, to driving a car for groceries and spending time with my family.

For the first two weeks I was so high that I woke up at 5am and started a day with a moment of gratitude and appreciation.

Then this habit faded away, and so my 'highness'.

Hence the lesson learned to do it properly in 2020.

To achieve it, I've created a short note that's one click away on my phone in order to read it every morning to remind myself of:
1. What I have?
2. Why I'm here?
3. Why I'm doing this?
4. Where I want to be?

Four simple questions that give me a clear direction for each day. It helps me focus better and plan better.

And guess what? It's a mini habit too, it takes me 1 min to read through these points.
