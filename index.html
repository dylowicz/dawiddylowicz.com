<p>I teach software testing at <a href="https://morethantesting.com" target="_blank">More Than Testing</a> and curate a newsletter at <a href="https://softwaretestingweekly.com">Software Testing Weekly</a>.</p>

<p>
  After completing a master degree in computer science and helping international startups achieve the highest quality for the past 7 years, I eventually quit a QA Lead position in a London's fittech startup to begin an enterpreneurial journey and help other people excel at software testing.
