<p>I'm a 27 year-old Polish guy living in London, UK.</p>
<p>
  I hold a master degree in computer science. For the past 7 years, I've worked as a software tester. Recently, I quit a QA Lead position in a London's fittech startup to begin an enterpreneurial journey and help other people excel at software testing.
</p>
<p>Now, I teach software testing at <a href="https://morethantesting.com" target="_blank">More Than Testing</a> and curate a newsletter at <a href="https://softwaretestingweekly.com">Software Testing Weekly</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>Over time, I've hacked my life here and there. I share about it on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p> -->
